# Remote Legal Teams

In this project we are focusing on informing lawyers about the opportunities of virtual collaboration, to leverage useful technology while avoiding risk for the organization for “the lawyer and her/his clients” and even “for the own law firm”. The project worked in several phases:

* Introductory paper including a how-to-style Annex: Remote Legal Teams—Getting Started and Making It Work!
  published on the [Liquid Legal Institute's website](https://www.liquid-legal-institute.com/workinggroups/remote-legal-teams/) and on the Legal Business World [website](https://www.legalbusinessworld.com/post/remote-legal-teams-getting-started-and-making-it-work) and in [issue 1/2021 of their magazine](https://lbw2021us11.legalbusinesslibrary.com/index-h5.html?page=72#page=72)
* A design thinking driven qualitative research run, interviewing many lawyers working remotely
* Writing a paper about 10 frequently asked questions on remote legal work, available on [Liquid Legal Institute's website](https://www.liquid-legal-institute.com/workinggroups/remote-legal-teams/)

We are looking forward to hearing your feedback, and you are cordially invited to join the project within the Liquid Legal Institute.
