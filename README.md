# Remote Legal Teams

In this project we are focusing on informing lawyers about the opportunities of virtual collaboration, to leverage useful technology while avoiding risk for the organization for “the lawyer and her/his clients” and even “for the own law firm”. We have created an introductory paper including a how-to-style annex. As a next step, we will do user research including qualitative and quantitative aspects. 

The introductory paper will be made available shortly and the link will be shared here.

We are looking forward to hearing your feedback, and you are cordially invited to join our research efforts!
